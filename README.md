# Etch-a-Sketch
Welcome to Etch-a-Sketch! this web application is a recreation of the classic etch-a-sketch using a grid layout to draw. Hover your mouse over the squares to color them in. At te top of the screen you will have the options to: 
- clear the grid and start over 
- change the amount of pixels in the grid by entering the number of pixels per column and row you would like.
- enable Rainbow Mode! makes the pixels change into a random color instead of black.

**Enjoy!**
